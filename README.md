# Hi there, I'm Santo 👋

I'm a third-year ICT student passionate about software developer with a love for coding and creating projects. My journey in programming started with learning C, Java, and a bit of C++, and I’ve especially enjoyed working with Java. I'm currently looking into the world of app development, as I believe it’s my niche. I’ve also taken a keen interest in cross-platform app development, exploring tools like Flutter.

## What I'm Working On
- 📱 Exploring cross-platform mobile app development with tools like **Flutter** and learning **Dart**
- 💻 Building a strong portfolio to showcase my projects and skills.

## A Bit More About Me
- 🎨 I enjoy designing with **Canva** and have a good eye for aesthetics.
- ✍️ I write poems and enjoy literature, especially the works of **Humayun Ahmed**, **Paulo Coelho**, **Qazi Anwar Hussain**, **Zahir Raihan**, **Ahmed Sofa** etc.
- 🎮 I’ve built console-based games like **Chopsticks** and **Vocab Victory** in Java.
- 🎬 I'm a **Marvel** fan, but I love all sorts of Sci-fi, superhero movies.
- 💭 My favorite quote is: ***"If it causes no harm to anyone, do whatever you feel like. Cause, NOBODY GIVES A SHIT!!!"*** - Me🤲
